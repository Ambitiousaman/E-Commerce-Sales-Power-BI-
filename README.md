# E-Commerce-Sales-Power-BI-
This project showcases an interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to help businesses analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability across different regions and product categories.
The dashboard transforms raw sales data into meaningful business insights, enabling smarter decision-making and improved operational efficiency.

**📌 Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data and create a visually compelling dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs).
The dashboard provides a 360° view of sales performance, helping business teams understand:
1) Which product categories generate the highest sales?
2) Which payment modes customers prefer?
3) Which states or regions contribute the most revenue?
4) Who are the top customers based on purchase value?
5) What months are most profitable?
Using a modern UI and intuitive visualizations, the dashboard allows users to drill down and explore insights effortlessly.

**✨ What This Dashboard Does**
1) Displays total sales amount, quantity sold, total profit, and average order value (AOV)
2) Visualizes product category performance and identifies best-selling items
3) Shows state-wise revenue contribution to identify strong and weak markets
4) Highlights top customers based on purchase trends
5) Analyzes payment mode preferences like UPI, COD, Debit/Credit Card, EMI, etc.
6) Provides monthly profit trends for better planning and forecasting
7) Helps business teams make data-driven decisions for marketing, inventory, and sales strategies
All visuals are interactive and optimized for smooth analysis.

**🛠️ Tech Stack Used**
1) Power BI Desktop – dashboard building, data modeling, visualization
2) Power Query – data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
3) DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – calculated measures and KPIs
4) Excel/CSV dataset – used as the data source
5) GitHub – project documentation and version control

**📂 Dataset Details**
1) The dataset contains essential e-commerce transactional data including:
2) Customer details (Name, State)
3) Product category & sub-category
4) Order amount, quantity, and profit
5) Payment modes (UPI, COD, Debit Card, Credit Card, EMI, etc.)
6) Order month & other sales attributes
Before visualization, the dataset was cleaned in Power Query, missing values were handled, and additional calculated measures were created using DAX to support deeper insights.

**📊 Key Insights Captured in the Dashboard**
1) Total Amount: 161K+
2) Total Quantity Sold: 2008+ units
3) Total Profit: 26K+
4) Average Order Value: 44K (AOV)
